# Titanic Survival Prediction Project  

This project applies Machine Learning algorithms to the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset to predict the survival of passengers.  

## About the Project  
The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner-friendly challenges on Kaggle. This repository is designed to guide beginners on how to start their Kaggle journey and approach their first Machine Learning project. The notebook takes a step-by-step approach to explain key topics in a way that's easy for anyone to understand.  

## Dependencies  
To run the project, you’ll need the following:  
- **Python 3**  
- **Numpy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**  
- **Classification Algorithms**  

## What’s Covered in This Notebook  

### Data Handling  
- Importing data using Pandas  
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data  
- Visualizing and exploring data with Matplotlib  

### Data Analysis  
- Supervised Machine Learning Techniques, including:  
  - Logistic Regression Model  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with 3 different kernels  
  - Basic Random Forest  
  - Visualizing and interpreting results  

This repository is perfect for those just starting their Machine Learning journey and looking for a straightforward and practical introduction to the field.
